# Mass Effect–Inspired Admin Dashboard

This project is part of **The Odin Project – Intermediate HTML & CSS Course**.  
The goal was to recreate a full dashboard layout using **CSS Grid**, while focusing on structure, layout organization, and clean component design. I decided to theme the dashboard after the Mass Effect universe, giving it a holographic “Omni-Tool / N7 terminal” aesthetic.

## Project Overview

The dashboard includes:

- A vertical sidebar navigation panel  
- A top panel with heading and alert ticker  
- A main content area with mission cards  
- A right panel showing squad information and system diagnostics  

All layout sections were built using **CSS Grid**, following the assignment instructions:  
side panel → header → content → right panel → nested grid elements.
